Hello World Project.

I decided to improve my computer skills, and to test them. syntax of all languages is more or less similar, 
so why not learn all of their basics. The main difference is classes/libraries, I am not planning to memorize them. 
I want to learn to use internet for searching needed class/library and use my programming language understanding 
to use class/library correctly in right place with right parameters.

This project includes scripts of "Hello world" message in different programming languages. 
This message is viewed in GUI (not in console), also function is in different class (file).

C++ OpenGL - compiled with g++ (Linux).
QtCreator - interface is made via Qt designer (Linux).
Python -  (Linux).
Ruby -  (Linux).
C# -  (windows).
HTML CSS PHP -  (apache).
